    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>Hi There! My name is Madina Inagamova. I'm currently studying Information Systems and exploring 
    different career paths like QA Testing or Data Analyst. I also love painting cityscapes, traveling, and studying psychology. My dream is to build a career that allows me to combine technology, business, and creativity. 
    I also love being outdoors in nature because it inspires and calms me.
 </p>

 <p>One of my favourite websites that inspires me is 
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>,
    because I've learned a lot from this website for complete free.
 </p>
